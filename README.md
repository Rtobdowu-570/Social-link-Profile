### Continued development


In my journey to becoming a Full-stack developer, I plan to focus on:

- **JavaScript Frameworks**: Dive deeper into frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js to enhance my frontend development skills.
- **Backend Development**: Learn server-side technologies such as Node.js, Express, or Django to build robust backend systems.
- **Databases**: Understand both SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) databases to manage and store data efficiently.
- **API Development**: Gain experience in building and consuming RESTful and GraphQL APIs to enable seamless frontend-backend communication.
- **DevOps Practices**: Explore tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines to streamline development processes and deployments.
- **Cloud Services**: Familiarize myself with cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for scalable application hosting and services.
- **Testing**: Implement unit, integration, and end-to-end testing to ensure code quality and reliability.
- **Security**: Learn best practices for securing applications at both the frontend and backend levels.
